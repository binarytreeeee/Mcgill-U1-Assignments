Question 1
    1.1
    The discussion shows that software are not made from scratch as much anymore and
that any software that uses a getChar is a software system that is made up of many 
other programs. It also demonstrates the idea of encapsulation in software systems 
as a means of abstraction.
    
    1.2
    The string exists as binary bits that are interpreted as characters in a character set. The application sends the string to the OS through it's api. The OS uses it's kernel to send the the data to the network card through the firmware. The firmware has an api that allows this communication. The network card formats the bits into packets that are sent on a defined protocol such UDP or TCP.
